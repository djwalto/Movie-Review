# Trending Movie Saga

## Description

Duration: 3 days

Full stack software application used to display top movies from database and allow user to edit. User lands on homepage with top trending movies displayed. User is then able to click the movie poster and show details on selected movie including description. User then has two buttons one to go back to home and one to edit. User can then edit title and description of the movie chosen for their own reasons. User is alerted to confirm update then redirected back to the home page.

## Prerequisites

SQL, React, Redux, NPM

## Installation

Create a database.

The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.

The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.

1. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
2. Run npm run server in your terminal
3. Run npm run client in your terminal
4. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
